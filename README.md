# Blog Post
This is my capstone project, the goal of this project is to create a Blog web application using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. The application will allow users to create and view blog posts. Posts will not persist between sessions as no database will be used in this version of the application.

## Running the Server
To run the server just run :
```
npm i
```
```
nodemon index.js
```
and go to
```
localhost:3000/
```
